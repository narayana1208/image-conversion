				ASSIGNMENT-3
I had given presentation in the class .i am mentioning this as sir asked us to mention while sending file.

The following are the steps to send image 
1.i wrote a program which takes image and converts it to numbers and writes it to a file.
2.In the same program it collects all the numbers from file and converts it to image.



disadvantages:

1.we have to manually do some meaningful text with the produced numbers in order to
prevent hackers from knowing that it is a image.



image name i took in file name is "focs.jpg" which i stored in "D://java/focs.jpg"

it produces one doc file which stores in "D://test.doc";

it reproduces image again in the same folder as "D://java//rose2.java".
